In the fast-paced world of luxury hotels, AtliQ Grands faced revenue challenges that threatened its market share. As an aspiring Data Analyst, I took on the challenge of transforming the fortunes of this prestigious 5-star hotel chain in India.

Here’s a quick overview of some key facts about AtliQ Grands:

➡️ AtliQ Grands is a renowned five-star hotel chain with a presence in four vibrant cities.

➡️ The chain boasts a network of seven distinct properties across these urban centers, each strategically located to serve a diverse clientele.

➡️ Guests can choose from four room categories: Elite, Premium, Presidential, and Standard, ensuring a tailored experience for every visitor.

➡️ To enhance convenience, AtliQ Grands offers reservations through six major booking platforms, optimizing accessibility and ease of booking.

Project Scope: My mission was clear—to harness the power of data and perform exploratory data analysis that would pave the way for smarter decision-making at AtliQ Grands. To achieve this, we leveraged several datasets:

dim_date: This table contains date-related information, such as dates, week numbers, and day types (weekend and weekday). We used this data to analyze booking trends over time.

dim_hotels: This table provided crucial details about the properties, including property ID, property name, category, and cities. It was essential for understanding the hotel chain's properties and their characteristics.

dim_rooms: This table included information about room IDs and room classes. We used this data to analyze which types of rooms were more popular or profitable.

fact_aggregated_bookings: This fact table contained data related to property ID, check-in dates, room categories, successful bookings, and capacity. It served as a crucial source for calculating key metrics related to bookings and occupancy.
